### Why not Laravel?

---

Since we will be using a client-side framework, the server will act only as a REST-API.
With such a setup, it is not necessary to have a full-fledged framework like Laravel.
Lumen is a lighter framework that still offers the best that Laravel has to offer such
as the IoC container, Facades, and Eloquent.
